<p>Faxzorz aims to revolutionize the cloud based mobile to land-line industry. Our system relies entirely on the magical
	power of the cloud. How neat is that? You may be thinking: "Wow! Super cool!". And we think you're right. Because, LBH
	(lets be honest), of course Faxzorz is cool. It's awesome as shit.</p>
	
<p>So how does it work? Simple. You send a text to +1-720-549-9985 that contains the 11 digit fax number (please include "+1" or
	whatever country code you would like to send your fax to) of the recipient as well as the 140 character message that you 
	want to send. For this to work correctly, make sure that you place the recipients fax number is placed in parenthesis 
	"( )" with the number enclosed inside. Also, it is best if the recipient's fax number is the first thing in the text. 
	For example, your text should be formatted in this way:</p>
	
<p id="sms">
	&lt;To&gt; +17205499985 <br />
	&lt;Message&gt; (+13035551234) Hey bro, I'm just checking out Faxzorz, itz teh most rad, retro, and super hip way to communicate. Visit
	Faxzorz.com if you consider yourself cool!</p>

<p>Where the number "(+17205551234)" is the number of the fax machine that you would like to send the message.</p>
	
<p>Pretty neat, huh? Well, what are you waiting for? Get after it!</p>

<p>PS - Since this site costs me (the developer) money to host and develop, I'm only going to allow users a maximum of <b>3</b>
	text to fax messages. If it were free to host, use Twilio, and use PamFaxer, I would let you have unlimited access to this
	revolutionary new technology, but its not, so I can't. But if you really like this service and you would like access to more
	SMS2FAX messages, you can hit me up via the link at the bottom of the page and I could probably hook you up with a sweet deal
	on more SMS2FAX messages.</p>
